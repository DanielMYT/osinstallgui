# Sample osinstallgui configuration file - EDIT this for your distribution.

# Some options are MANDATORY, and osinstallgui won't run if they are unset.
# Some options are OPTIONAL, and defaults will be used if they are unset.
# However, we recommend that you set EVERY available option, for robustness.

# Path to the rootfs, which can be either a squashfs image or a tarball.
# This is a mandatory option, because the path will vary depending on the OS.
OSINSTALLGUI_ROOTFS="/run/initramfs/live/LiveOS/squashfs.img"

# Path to a backup rootfs, in case the main rootfs is not found.
# This is optional and can be omitted if you don't have a backup rootfs.
OSINSTALLGUI_ROOTFS_ALT="/run/initramfs/squashed.img"

# Script that should run to clean up the target system after installation.
# For example, you will likely want to remove files specific to the live CD.
# It will run in a chroot and should be included in the rootfs image.
# The option can be left empty or unset if no cleanup script is required.
OSINSTALLGUI_CLEANUP_CMD="/tmp/livecd-cleanup.sh"

# Command that should run on the target system to generate the initramfs.
# This is mandatory, because the initramfs system differs between distros.
OSINSTALLGUI_INITRAMFS_CMD="/usr/sbin/mkinitramfs"

# Set to 0 to mandate the use of ext4 for the root partition.
# This option has no effect if btrfs-progs is not installed.
# If unset, 1 is used if btrfs-progs is installed, and 0 is used if not.
OSINSTALLGUI_ALLOW_BTRFS=1

# Set to 0 to disable support for disk encryption using LUKS.
# If enabled, the user will be able to choose whether to use encryption or not.
# This option has no effect if cryptsetup is not installed.
# If unset, 1 is used if cryptsetup is installed, and 0 is used if not.
# Please see the FAQ document for other needed prerequisites for LUKS support.
OSINSTALLGUI_ALLOW_LUKS=1

# Path of the locale generation tool which wraps around 'localedef' from glibc.
# There is no POSIX standard mandating what it needs to be called.
# Some distros call it 'locale-gen'. MassOS calls it 'mklocales'.
# This is a mandatory option.
OSINSTALLGUI_LOCALES_CMD="/usr/sbin/mklocales"

# Path of the locale definitions file referenced by the above utility.
# Again there is no standard. It may be 'locale.gen'. MassOS uses 'locales'.
# This is a mandatory option.
OSINSTALLGUI_LOCALES_FILE="/etc/locales"

# Set to 1 to use systemd's localectl to find the list of supported keymaps.
# Set to 0 to search the filesystem manually instead, for non-systemd systems.
# If this option is omitted, osinstallgui will auto-detect but prefer systemd.
# Note that the manual search method is slightly slower.
OSINSTALLGUI_KEYMAPS_SYSTEMD=1

# Specify the location of console keymaps on the system.
# This option is ignored and not needed if OSINSTALLGUI_KEYMAPS_SYSTEMD=1.
# If needed but omitted, '/usr/share/keymaps' will be used by default.
# This is the defacto location, but some distros may deviate from this norm.
# Arch Linux, for example, uses '/usr/share/kbd/keymaps' instead.
OSINSTALLGUI_KEYMAPS_LOCATION="/usr/share/keymaps"

# Set to 1 to prompt the user to set a password for the root account.
# If set to 0, the root password will not be set and the root account disabled.
# Users can still elevate using 'sudo', but system recovery may become harder.
# Note that the field can be left empty by the user, which will keep it unset.
# If unset, 1 is used by default.
OSINSTALLGUI_ROOTPW=1

# Group(s) for administrator users, i.e., the primary user account.
# Most distros use 'wheel', but it could alternatively be 'adm' or 'sudo'.
# You may use a comma-separated list if there are multiple admin groups.
# This is a mandatory option.
OSINSTALLGUI_ADMIN_GROUP="wheel"

# Default login shell for user accounts. It must be listed in '/etc/shells'.
# This is a mandatory option.
OSINSTALLGUI_USER_SHELL="/usr/bin/bash"

# Set to 1 to enforce strong passwords for the user account.
# This requires the 'cracklib-check' program from cracklib to be installed.
# It's only really makes sense to use if shadow was built with libcrack.
# The option will default to 0 if unset.
OSINSTALLGUI_USER_PWSCORE=0
